# Networking-Labs
Computer networks labs using C and Wireshark. 
OSI layers were analyzed using wireshark and server-client programs were written in C using TCP and UDP from scratch for various purposes, such as transfering files and remotely executing commands.

All lab reports containing code and explanations have been merged into a single PDF file named `All Labs Merged.pdf`.
